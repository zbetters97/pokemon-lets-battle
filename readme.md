# POKéMON: Let's Battle!

A simple Java-based Pokémon fan game with a custom-built game-engine.

## Description

Welcome to the world of Pokémon! 
This Java-based rpg uses a custom-built engine in IntelliJ learned from [RyiSnow](https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow) to showcase many features from the mainline Pokémon video-game series. 
All the sprite work was ported over from Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire and Fire Red/Leaf Green.
